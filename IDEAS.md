* Just as Greek mathematics heavily emphasized geometry, Danetian mathematics
could heavily emphasize algorithms, e.g. for computing square roots, computing
pi, multiplication, etc. Try to come up with a design for a pebbles-based
computer, just like an abacus, which can implement all algorithms known to the
Danetians.
