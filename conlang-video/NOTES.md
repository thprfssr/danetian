# How to make an Indo-European conlang

* Start the video by going to wiktionary.org and getting a list of PIE words.
* Then, go to the SCA2 page, and paste your words.
* Play around with the sound changes until you have something that
you're satisfied with.
* Once you're satisfied with your sound changes, start systematically applying
them to every word you can get ahold of.
* Then, start discovering the grammar of the language.

This video will basically show you how I created my conlang, Danetian.
