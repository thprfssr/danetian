1. In the before-boundary, God produced the skies and the earth.
2. The earth was not-full and not-rich. And darkness was over the broadness
of the waters. And the breath of God went over the waters.
3. And God said «Light, be produced!». And light was produced.
4. And God saw the light, which was good. And God split light from
darkness.
5. And God gave the name «day» to the light, and the name «night» to the
darkness.
6. And God said «Strongness between the waters, be produced! Separate
waters from waters!».
7. And God produced the strongness. And He separated the waters which were
over the strongness from those which were under the strongness. And it was
finished.
8. God gave the name «sky» to the strongness. And sunrise and sunset were
finished. That was the first day.
9. And God said «Waters under the sky, come together into one sole stance!
Dry, be produced!». And it was finished.
10. And God gave the name «earth» to the dry, and the name «seas» to the
one sole stance of waters. And God saw that it was good.
11. And God said, «Earth, produce rich plants which produce seeds and trees
of fruit with their own race, whose seeds in them are over the earth!». And
it was finished.
12. And the earth produced rich plants, and plants which produce seeds with
their race, and trees which produce fruits in which are seeds with their
race. And God saw that it was good.
