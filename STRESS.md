## Orthographical rules for default placement of stress
1. By default, stress falls on the back-most vowel _letter_, up to the third
vowel _letter_. (Diphthongs count as a single vowel letter).
2. If a word ends in a liquid consonant (r, l), then the last syllable is
stressed by default.
3. If a word ends in "-ia", then the stress falls on the "-ía" by default.
4. If rule #1 makes it so that the stressed vowel is followed directly by an
unstressed vowel, then the stress is shifted forward. For instance, when we
write "foiderationes", it's pronounced "foideratiónes" and not "foideratíones".
