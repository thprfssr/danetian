    Genesis 1
    1. In the before-boundary, God produced the skies and the earth.
    2. The earth was not-full and not-rich. And darkness was over the
    broadness of the waters. And the breath of God went over the waters.
    3. And God said «Light, be produced!». And light was produced.
    4. And God saw the light, which was good. And God split light from
    darkness.
    5. And God gave the name «day» to the light, and the name «night» to the
    darkness.
    6. And God said «Strongness between the waters, be produced! Separate
    waters from waters!».
    7. And God produced the strongness. And He separated the waters which were
    over the strongness from those which were under the strongness. And it was
    finished.
    8. God gave the name «sky» to the strongness. And sunrise and sunset were
    finished. That was the first day.
    9. And God said «Waters under the sky, come together into one sole stance!
    Dry, be produced!». And it was finished.
    10. And God gave the name «earth» to the dry, and the name «seas» to the
    one sole stance of waters. And God saw that it was good.
    11. And God said, «Earth, produce rich plants which produce seeds and trees
    of fruit with their own race, whose seeds in them are over the earth!». And
    it was finished.
    12. And the earth produced rich plants, and plants which produce seeds with
    their race, and trees which produce fruits in which are seeds with their
    race. And God saw that it was good.

    Notice also the ending of «īnstrumentālus». This is because the u-stem

    The u-stem forms were for masculine and neuter, and the i-stem forms were

    GRAMMATIKA

    * Have a zero copula
    * You don't need prepositions. You just need to construct phrases of the
    form {(loc) + (gen)}. Example: "Below the sky" could be "in the bottom of
    the sky"
    * The subjunctive can also be used to express desire, like an optative
    mood. "Vayamos al parque".
