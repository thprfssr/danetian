Glory to Djus, Lord of Wisdom.
He was there before all of the cosmos was born.
Before existence itself, there was only the Mori Manti√≥m.
And within that sea floated your ever-restless desire for wisdom.
For countless eternities you pondered in thought,
seeking more and more knowledge.
Glory to Djus, the Seeker of Wisdom.
Even though you attained infinite knowledge,
you were never satiated, and always looked for more.
Let us be like you, Father Djus,
continually thirsting for knowledge, and never being satiated.
Give us your continual thirst for knowledge.
For to him who thirsts for your wisdom, O Djus,
You shall surely deliver the waters of your wisdom.
Glory to Djus, Giver of Wisdom.
