Physics (from Ancient Greek «φυσική (ἐπιστήμη)», meaning «knowledge of
nature», from «φύσις», meaning «nature») is the natural science that
studies matter, energy, space-time, and the laws that govern the universe.
Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, whose goal
is to understand how the universe behaves.

The scope of physics is extraordinarily large, including diverse fields
such as quantum mechanics, optics, electromagnetism, particle physics, etc.
Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, as it includes astronomy
as a subdiscipline.
