# Sol i Vents

Sol i Vents apomanjonto peri poterosjo bolisosjo, joives vojasjer opibémt
perislitos en tepi vesti. Somemanjonto jod pramos jo anasedoit en fektin
vojasjer aposlabjetin enosjo vestim andomnos vopomnos bolise joti aljos.

Sep Vents beblajet joti bruve joti enosmoi moktis, nu bruvise blajet, anfuise
perislíeto vojasjer som vestie. Tarmeni, protidedato Vents.

Sep Sol bere dedvelet, de ans atistaties aposeslabjet vojasjer vestim. Pos
tosmi, dedanót Vents jod Sol bolisos dvamos.

# The Wind and the Sun

The Sun and the Wind were disputing over which one was stronger, when a
traveller came wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the first one to
succeed in making the traveller take off his cloak should be called stronger
than the other.

So the Wind blew as heavily as he could, but the heavier he blew, the tighter
the traveler wrapped himself with the cloak. Eventually, the Wind gave up.

So the Sun burned warmly, and without delay, the traveller took off his cloak.
After this, the Wind admitted that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
